Technically is not my first video. ***My first real video on YouTube is from 2008.***

But this is a new beginning, so I call it my first video.

I haven't made the videos public yet, and I'll do so when I finish this entry.

For now I want to organize my thoughts.


## Making the video

When I started to make the video my goal was to make the best video I could. To use everything I know... and if I didn't know how to do something, figure out how to do it.

Because of my lack of experience, I ended up taking longer than I should. I rewrote things several times, re-recorded most of the voice-over, redid some scenes because I realized what I was saying was factually wrong, the style of the video made the editing a nightmare, and at one point I "finished" the editing and redid most of the scenes again because I was not content with the result.

A lot of this work could have been prevented if I organized my process of making the video differently, because a lot of the time I was redoing stuff.

***My ambition, put together with my lack of experience and resources, created a combination that caused me to take forever to make the video.***

Add to that that I dubbed and subtitled the whole thing in a foreign language (English) which I have difficulty speaking. And not only I dubbed it, the entire video track is in its corresponding language.  

There were parts that were fun to do, researching the whole thing, the beginning of the editing, re-doing the intro and several sections from 2005.

But at some point it started to feel like a chore and I wasn't enjoying the process anymore. Like "Come on! I've been doing this for months, I want to make a different video".

There are still some things that bother me, but I decided it's better to move on, make different videos and gain more experience.


## On the success of the video

Despite taking me several months making this, I knew full well I have no guarantees it would succeed. I'm keeping my expectations very low.

***If it gets between 100 and 1000 views I'll call it a success***. Beyond 1000 views is a dream. But I'm at a point where it doesn't drain me mentally.

Thanks to this experience, I'm not afraid anymore of investing a lot of time in something that may or may not give returns. Still... I shouldn't be careless.

I'm more worried about the reception of the video though. Whether if people in general think the video is good or not... but at this point that's beyond my control, so it would be wise not to worry about it.

Either way, I'll gain something in both scenarios.


## On future videos

I'm going to make a Q&A, then... maybe I will make "How Twitch was Made" (I still don't know) and this time I will do it quickly.

I can't repeat what I did here anymore, it is simply not sustainable long term and it's not good for me either. Right now I feel the best course of action is to figure out how to make videos quickly, even if that means I have to make them shorter.

There must be some degree of quality, because I need to build a reputation of making good videos. However at this point, where I'm just starting out, I believe frequency matters (contrary to popular belief).

Because even if the current video becomes a massive hit, I know if I upload in 2 months, people will forget about me because I'm not well known.

Once I proven I can make good videos, I think upload frequency can decrease.

And again ***I need to upload more, so I can learn quicker how to make videos***.


## Closing

It's time. I don't know when is going to be the next time I'm posting here, maybe a few days, a week, several months, a year, but eventually I will come back and write something.

I'm not going to lie to you. I'm a bit nervous of pressing "Public". Afraid of it getting a very negative reception... but if I want to find out what lies in the world where I did it... I must do it.

**And that's the world I chose.**
