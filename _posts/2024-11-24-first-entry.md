I guess you are here because you want to remember how it all started.

Well... sit down, read and *remember*.

At the time of writing this I'm currently making what I call "My first video". The video is about the founding of YouTube, its first two years (2005 and 2006) and everything that happened before its acquisition in October 2006.

The video has taken me around **one year** to make. 

*Sometimes I worked slowly on it,
Sometimes I worked quickly on it,
Sometimes I didn't do anything at all, and,
Sometimes I did everything all the time.*

Looking back... it shouldn't have taken one year to make, but I guess you can say it took me that long because I didn't know much about making a video at that scale. If I were to make something like that again in the future I'm pretty sure I would be able to do it faster.

Currently, the *Spanish* version of the video -the original version- is done. The date says that I rendered it exactly *one month ago*, on **October 17th 2005**.

At the moment, I'm translating it into English, a complete dub of the video. The hardest part wasn't translating the text, which was around 30 pages and something that I already did. What has been the *most difficult* so far is **to read the lines**.

I'm not a native speaker, so reading English aloud with the right rhythm and the right sounds without stuttering is very difficult for me. It takes me a long time to get it right, but in the end I can do it. And I know the more I do this, the better I get.

There are a *total of 1114 lines*. Currently *I have done 700*, at a rate of **30 lines a day**, which is around 2 minutes of video.

It feels like I do a tiny amount of lines each day, but to read them well takes me 2 hours. After that I need to synchronize subtitles and translate any text on the video into English, so it is like 3-4 hours every day. I could do more, but I decided to keep this pace to avoid losing my mind.

Why am I doing this? Because **it is what it has to be done**.

If I want the video I made to have a degree of relevance in the future, it has to be translated into English.

After all this is over, I'm moving on to make shorter videos. There is no way I can do something like this again in the short term, not without a team or changing the way I do the editing...

And besides, it is good for me to make shorter videos. More chances to get a feedback loop and learn from mistakes.

Regarding the video itself, I put a lot of care on it. 

I worked on this for a year knowing that it was very likely I wouldn't be able to get any revenue from it.
I did it knowing there was a high likelihood of no one watching it.
And I did it because I only wanted to make a good video.
To prove to myself that I can do it. 

*I don't know if it is good though.* 

I see a lot of faults, but no doubt this is my best work. 
I did everything I could to make it good and put my utmost effort while doing it, but *who knows if that was enough.*
Ultimately it doesn't matter, because at the end... 
*I'm proud of what I made.*

I learned a lot about YouTube and I understood why some things are the way they are today.
Some pieces are still missing, but what I got from doing this it's something I won't find anywhere else, something that I uncovered myself.

Maybe all this time all I needed was a single thing:

*To believe in my strengths.*

To stop finding the optimal answer in someone else's mouth.
To look inside myself, ask what I believe I should do based on what I see... 
and cling to that.

*To trust myself.*

Especially when what I'm doing is something that few have done.

Just like the co-founders of YouTube.

Chad, Steve and Jawed the co-founders of YouTube build the site for many months and for a long time they saw nothing in return. A lot of work and not a single cent of revenue because they weren't running any ads.

And then, at a time when they were getting less than 100,000 views daily for the entire site, at a time where there's a lot of uncertainty, a lot of questions without an answer, who knows if YouTube would be scalable, not to mention profitable, who knows if the site would still alive in 2 months because there is no revenue and little videos...

Chad goes and says that they are going to build a multi-billion dollar company and change the way people share video on the internet.

What an incredible guy.

They just knew things were going to work out, despite things not going that well at the beginning. I only have admiration and respect for people like that. For people that are commited to an idea where there's a lot to gain, despite sounding absurd.

I must admit that while I was making the video sometimes I could identify myself with that struggle to keep things moving forward. Sometimes finding similarities with their situation and mine. Although at the end I know things are at a quite different scale.

I hope that before the year ends, both videos (Spanish and English) are published. Regardless of the reception I'm content with what I made and I know it was done with good intent.

When that happens my next step will be figuring out what I will make next.

Keep moving and you will make it. You will build a big channel and change your and your family situation.
