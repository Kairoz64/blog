*It's been almost a month since I published my first video.*

Now, it didn't became a hit, which is ok, but what I find discouraging is that *the average watch time is around 2 minutes.*

*What a pity.*

I have a few theories:

- It's a big ask to watch a movie-length video from somebody who is completely unknown.
- The heavy accent makes people click off.
- The intro is simply not good.

Now... at the 30-second mark only 21% of people are still watching.

Man... *that's really bad.*

The worst thing is that I can't share the video myself, because it's super long, -*a big ask*- and I have doubts about the quality of the voice-over.

The Spanish version... man, I don't know anyone that would want to watch something like that.

*sigh*

What I know is that... if the channel grows, people will take a look to the first videos of the channel and those videos will start gaining more attention.

So better to start making more videos and ***NOW*** because it's been almost a month. I got distracted, and started to forget that ***this is important, this is I want to do.***

I tried to make the promised Q&A about the *How YouTube was Made* video, but I am ***SO*** awkward in front of the camera and honestly... I feel the content of the video won't be good.

Most of what I wanted to say about the making of YouTube was said in the original video. So I'm done. Time to talk about something else in the next video... and besides I wasn't having fun making the Q&A.

What I want to do for the next video, it's something easy to share. Something interesting and that doesn't demand much time and ***it HAS to be easy to make.***

Because I need to figure out how to upload more frequently.
