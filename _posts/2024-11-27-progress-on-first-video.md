title: Progress on First Video

It's been 3 days since I wrote the last entry.

I didn't mention this, but on November 15th I caught the flu and because of that I haven't been able to keep dubbing the video.

My voice became very raspy and I was constantly coughing because my throat was itching in one particular spot.

Just today in the morning it doesn't feel that itchy anymore, also my voice sounds clearer, which is good.

However because of that long break, enunciating things is going to become difficult again, keeping the rhythm, pronouncing the right sounds *sigh*. I just have to accept that there was nothing I could do and deal with what I have at hand (I tried to do stuff while being sick and I couldn't).

**The next days I'll be updating this entry and write my progress on the video.** When I feel I'm good to go and I start dubbing again, the dubbing is going to take *exactly 2 weeks*. During this time I also have to figure out the thumbnail. I've been sketching some ideas, but I still need to brainstorm more, because I want to make three thumbnails in order to have quick replacements in the case that the first one flops.

Today I started to do the dub again. I was a little slow because of that long break, but overall I had no problem. I am happy that I am able to do this again :)

I'm still slow, but I am able to achieve a *decent* pronunciation of the lines even after that long break. That's good, because I thought I had to relearn how to pronounce things all over again, that's a relief.

Today I was waaaay faster. Recording lines is getting easy.

Things were hard today. But I made it.
**Lines: 823/1114.**

Mmm... I forgot to post yesterday, but I haven't stopped working. Yesterday I had to work on a section that didn't require me pronouncing some lines and I only had to translate it. So as a result there was huge progress in these two days.

Today enouncing the lines was extremely difficult. Sometimes days like this one happens. My theory is that my brain is still trying to figure out how the rhythm of the English language works, but at the end I was able to come through.

Today was a bit easier compared to yesterday, but I'm not entirely convinced with the end result. There's really nothing I can do though. I just have to accept that for a while I'm going to have an accent and there's going to be some weirdness in my speech. For now, the only thing that matters is that I am understandable. I hope someday there is a day when I can watch the video and have a good laugh at how funny I sound lol.

I'm getting close.

Closer.

Yesterday I *rendered* the video.

After 2 months working on dubbing the video, it is finally *over*.
It is a little bit late at night right now and I feel a bit tired, but there's a lot I want to say.

While I was doing the dub, I decided I wanted to add an extra thing to the video. It is the *MD5 checksum* of my very *first video* on YouTube, **the one I made when I was 12**. After several years, I still have the original wmv file in my hard drive, something that you can't get by just downloading the video from YouTube.

I hid that MD5 checksum in the English dub, and decided to hid it in the original video in Spanish too, so I had to re-render it.

In total it took 6 hours to render both videos, 3 hours each. Man, sometimes I thought my laptop was going to burn itself. I hope there's a day when I can put that MD5 in good use.

I was feeling tempted to go back and re-do the first lines in the dub, because I knew those first lines probably are not the best, after all... those are the ones I made at the very beginning when I still didn't know how I was going to dub the whole thing. And I mean is the intro of the video... one of the most important parts if I want people to keep watching.

But at the end, I decided that I have to let it go, otherwise, I'll keep wanting to make things perfect and never releasing the video. 

*And for my own good I also need a break.*

So, what's left is the thumbnails.

I'll post some drawings tomorrow.

"Tomorrow" hehehe.

I got a bit distracted, that's why I'm posting right now.
Here are some drawings I made (not all of them).

I could spend a lot of time explaining what I'm aiming at with the thumbnail, but it's better that I keep it short.

I think **the thumbnail must describe accurately what the video is about**. Several times I thought about picking some highlight that happens in the middle of the video, but at the end I decided that I should represent something that happens at the very beginning. The reason is that you have to watch *half an hour* before you are in the middle of the video. That's waaaay too long to fulfill the "promise" you made in the thumbnail.

The alternative is to make *something that represents the video as a whole*. But I really really prefer to make *a thumbnail that shows something you can find at the very beginning of the video*.

The ideal scenario in my opinion is a thumbnail that has *both* attributes, and that means, the video itself must be structured in a certain way.

The other thing is that the thumbnail must be kind of unexpected, because if something is unexpected, it immediately keeps your attention.

Now, I don't know a lot of ways to do that. The only two ways I know are:
1. Breaking a pattern, which keeps attention for a short amount of time, because you are surprised.
2. Making an interesting question, which keeps attention for a long amount of time because of curiosity.

Oops! I think I rambled a bit long about thumbnails hahaha.

Anyway, after thinking a lot, I decided I'm making the thumbnails in picture 4. I have no idea if they are effective, but I have to make them if I want to know that.

But you see... *I already made them*.

In fact, I only have to make the videos public.

...

Tomorrow in the morning when everyone is awake.
