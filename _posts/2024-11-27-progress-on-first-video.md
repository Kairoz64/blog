title: Progress on First Video

It's been 3 days since I wrote the last entry.

I didn't mention this, but on November 15th I caught the flu and because of that I haven't been able to keep dubbing the video.

My voice became very raspy and I was constantly coughing because my throat was itching in one particular spot.

Just today in the morning it doesn't feel that itchy anymore, also my voice sounds clearer, which is good.

However because of that long break, enunciating things is going to become difficult again, keeping the rhythm, pronouncing the right sounds *sigh*. I just have to accept that there was nothing I could do and deal with what I have at hand (I tried to do stuff while being sick and I couldn't).

**The next days I'll be updating this entry and write my progress on the video.** When I feel I'm good to go and I start dubbing again, the dubbing is going to take *exactly 2 weeks*. During this time I also have to figure out the thumbnail. I've been sketching some ideas, but I still need to brainstorm more, because I want to make three thumbnails in order to have quick replacements in the case that the first one flops.

Today I started to do the dub again. I was a little slow because of that long break, but overall I had no problem. I am happy that I am able to do this again :)

I'm still slow, but I am able to achieve a *decent* pronunciation of the lines even after that long break. That's good, because I thought I had to relearn how to pronounce things all over again, that's a relief.

Today I was waaaay faster. Recording lines is getting easy.

Things were hard today. But I made it.

Mmm... I forgot to post yesterday, but I haven't stopped working. Yesterday I had to work on a section that didn't require me pronouncing some lines and I only had to translate it. So as a result there was huge progress in these two days.

Today enouncing the lines was extremely difficult. Sometimes days like this one happens. My theory is that my brain is still trying to figure out how the rhythm of the English language works, but at the end I was able to come through.

Today was a bit easier compared to yesterday, but I'm not entirely convinced with the end result. There's really nothing I can do though. I just have to accept that for a while I'm going to have an accent and there's going to be some weirdness in my speech. For now, the only thing that matters is that I am understandable. I hope someday there is a day when I can watch the video and have a good laugh at how funny I sound lol.
