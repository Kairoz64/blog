It's been 3 days since I wrote the last entry.

I didn't mention this, but on November 15th I caught the flu and because of that I haven't been able to keep dubbing the video.

My voice became very raspy and I was constantly coughing because my throat was itching in one particular spot.

Just today in the morning it doesn't feel that itchy anymore, also my voice sounds clearer, which is good.

However because of that long break, enunciating things is going to become difficult again, keeping the rhythm, pronouncing the right sounds *sigh*. I just have to accept that there was nothing I could do and deal with what I have at hand (I tried to do stuff while being sick and I couldn't).

**The next days I'll be updating this entry and write my progress on the video.** When I feel I'm good to go and I start dubbing again, the dubbing is going to take *exactly 2 weeks*. During this time I also have to figure out the thumbnail. I've been sketching some ideas, but I still need to brainstorm more, because I want to make three thumbnails in order to have quick replacements in the case that the first one flops.

Today I started to do the dub again. I was a little slow because of that long break, but overall I had no problem. I am happy that I am able to do this again :)

I'm still slow, but I am able to achieve a *decent* pronunciation of the lines even after that long break. That's good, because I thought I had to relearn how to pronounce things all over again, that's a relief.

Today I was waaaay faster. Recording lines is getting easy.
